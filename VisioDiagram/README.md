arc42-process-diagram
==========================

This diagram is being developed using visio. ( I know ;) ) I've choosen it because the svg exporter works pretty well.
Using DOM-Manipulation with php, i am able to add generated links to sub sites. Each element has an subpage that is located in the arc42 subfolder.

Clicking on an element, loads the corresponding subsite. 

In future you can use an easy ansiidoc syntax to mark headers and lists in those subsites.
